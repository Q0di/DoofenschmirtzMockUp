AngularJS Website
This is just a practice page I made.
It uses JSON and Angular to dynamically fill the page template with content.
It shows how to use an http get request and how to use ngRoutes for the paths to defferent pages on a website.
Not the standard use for angular but like I said it's a practice example.
Maybe some platipus will get a laught out of it.
